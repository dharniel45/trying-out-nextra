# What is deBridge
 
deBridge is a secure interoperability layer for Web3 that enables decentralized transfers of arbitrary messages and value between various blockchains. The validation of cross-chain transactions is performed by a network of independent validators who are elected by and work for deBridge governance. Validators maintain the blockchain infrastructure and each run a deBridge node to sign all transactions that pass through deBridge smart contracts in different blockchains. 

Delegated staking and slashing mechanics act as a backbone for protocol security and provide economic disincentives for validators to collude.
The deBridge protocol is an infrastructure platform and a framework for:

decentralized transfer of arbitrary data and assets
cross-chain interoperability and composability of smart contracts
cross-chain swaps
interoperability and bridging of NFTs 

Projects can integrate with deBridge infrastructure to tap into the various cross-chain opportunities that we enable. These can for instance be:

Build own custom bridges for assets and NFTs preserving custom NFT logic (e.g. breeding) 
Enable users from other blockchain ecosystems interact with their protocol (enable global accessibility)
Scale up their protocol to other chains and exchange commands/messages between components of their protocol
Make their protocol composable with protocols from other ecosystems
Build new types of cross-chain applications and primitives
Enable global accessibility by letting users and protocols from other chains seamlessly interact with the protocol
